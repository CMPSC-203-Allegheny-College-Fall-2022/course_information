# Conduct Guide for Software Engineering

## [Code of Conduct Repository](https://github.com/CMPSC-203-Allegheny-College-Fall-2022/code-of-conduct)

## Categories of Conduct

### Overall Conduct

It is expected that the main attitude in the class is to be encouraging and positive, towards yourself and each other. Since this class is mainly based on teams, it is very important that everyone respects each others contribution and provides constructive feedback when necessary. All students are expected to show respect to everyone both inside, and outside the classroom. Students are expected to come to class on time and prepared for collaboration.

#### Acceptable Conduct

- Students coming to every class.
- Pay attention in class and take notes.
- Not distracting other people in class.
- Be respectful.
- Be constructive with feedback.

#### Unacceptable Conduct

- Not coming to class.
- Students not bringing their computer.
- Distracting people in class.
- Disrespectful towards peers, TA's and Professor.

### Deadlines

The deadline for each task should be 12am. This will help other contributors to review and make changes where necessary before class time in order to have a sense of clarity on with problems need to be resolved or worked on. Deadlines also help with feedback that is always necessary for the project we will be doing.

#### Acceptable Conduct

- Doing the work on time.
- Telling the team that you finished your work.
- Doing the work with time and do not rush things.

#### Unacceptable Conduct

- Students not doing the work.
- Not telling the team that the job they had was finished.
- Students not finishing homework.

### Communication

Communication is the cornerstone of collaboration, and all communications for team-based activities in the Software Engineering course must adhere to the below guidelines for professionalism. To be clear, we recognize two platforms for our official communication: Discord and GitHub. That having been said, the below guidelines ought to be followed for any in-person communication pertaining to or within the classroom.

#### Acceptable Conduct

Students are encouraged to:

- Be proactive about communicating. This can include utilizing whatever platforms necessary to let others know ahead of time of any kinds of changes, concerns, or ideas.

- Constructively criticize others. For example, students should give honest and beneficial suggestions that do not alienate others and their work, which will encourage later participation.

- Acknowledge others. Students should not isolate themselves or isolate others from any form of communication. Students should pull one another, and themselves, into the loop.

#### Unacceptable Conduct

Students are discouraged from:

- Be passive aggressive/disrespectful. When communicating it is essential to be careful about the way you speak, so that others are not offended or hurt by your words.

- Never ask questions. Students should always be willing to use the communication platforms to resolve any sort of questions they may have.

- Never listen to criticism/feedback. The constructive criticism and feedback given by others is important to take in and consider. They are giving feedback to help better your work.

### Participation

Students are expected to participate in a meaningful capacity during class activities in this course by being actively engaged in class discussion, asking questions when needed, and attending class on a regular basis. This section will outline the acceptable and unacceptable conduct when it comes to class participation. Students should follow these guidelines when participating in classroom activities.

#### Acceptable Conduct

Students are encouraged to:

- Participate and engage in class discussions.
- Ask questions when in need of additional assistance.
- Attend all class sessions and practical lab sessions.

#### Unacceptable Conduct

- Not participating at all throughout class sessions
- Not paying attention while in class
- Doing other classwork during designated class time
- Skipping class

### Decisions

Decisions are the action or process of deciding something or of resolving a question. Decisions are the process of making choices by identifying a decision, gathering information, and assessing alternative resolutions.

#### Acceptable Conduct

- Create decision that mutually benefit each other (Schedules, Coding). This is to help understand each other's responsibilities and respect on what is possible for both individual interest and the team interest.
- Decisions made in the class in terms of software engineering whether assignments or group work projects should be inline with the code of conduct and not biased to any particular student.
- If all group members do not agree on a decision, alternative choices should be proposed. This would allow group members to come to a compromise if they do not agree with the course the project is being taken in.

#### Unacceptable Conduct

- Never informing on others on unattended appointments. This will only create more problems as other team members has to do more work unexpectedly, therefore the work will not be as good as intended to be.
- It is unacceptable to make decisions in the class alone when collaborating on a project as it is group work and decisions are aimed to be made as a group so as to enhance teamwork and collaboration.
- Group members should not make major decisions just before the due date. In other words, major aspects of the project should not be changed at the last minute since there would not be enough time to fully implement these changes.

### Postmortems

Postmortems is an analysis or discussion of an event held soon after it has occurred, especially in order to determine why it was a failure. A post-mortem is where a team reflects on what went wrong with something they did, and documents it and/or amends their process to stop it happening again.

#### Acceptable Conduct

- Always be transparent on what are we doing wrong with each other. The reason being is because to create a mutual relationship environment between the team to understand the good and the bad of the activity together.
- Accept criticism both positive and negative. So that you can grow as a team member and software engineer.
- Be flexible. Don't be unwilling to change your process if it's not working.

#### Unacceptable Conduct

- Never create unnecessary mistakes (Forget to git pull, never creating pull requests). This is very important to not create more problems and not to halt on the team's progress on the work.
- Pushing all the blame onto one person. We're all part of our own teams and as team members if we all try our best the responsibility should be shared.
- Refusing to listen to others opinions and advice.

### Conflicts

Students experiencing conflicts should come together to fix the problem. No argument
should result in fighting. Teams or groups should work together to solve any
conflicts in the class. When dealing with conflicts, if resolutions cannot be resolved,
then they should take conflicts to Professor to resolve said issues. Lastly, students
should try to come together to peacefully resolve conflict.

#### Acceptable Conduct

- Students should try to understand the other persons point of view.
- Students should talk directly and calmly to the other person.
- Students should listen to everything that the other person is saying.

#### Unacceptable Conduct

- Students should not be rude when there is a conflict.
- Students should not get angry at other individuals.
- Students should not raise their voice when there is a conflict.

### Infractions

Below will be outlining what is acceptable and unacceptable conduct. If followed,
there should be no problems
throughout the course of the year. Infraction is the act of breaking something, so for this class this will mean the act of
breaking acceptable conduct. You should be able to follow all of the acceptable conducts in the class, and that will lead
the students to a good, and efficient year in this class.

#### Acceptable Conduct

- Acceptable work would be turning work in to the class on time. Make sure that assignments aren't late and have a passing build.
- Acceptable work would contain work being completed to the highest level of completion. Use concepts that we have learned to class and apply it to the work on
projects.
- Acceptable work would also consist following the Honor Code from Allegheny College with work in the class.

#### Unacceptable Conduct

- Unacceptable work would consist of being turning in work late after the posted due date.
- Unacceptable work would consist of not following other class rules and taking advantage of the system of the class.
- Unacceptable work would contain not doing the work in the class and not turning in assignments of the class.

To report any violations of the code of conduct, students can submit an [anonymous form](https://forms.gle/vmwMwmrDEgq7yszK9).
