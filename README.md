### Description

Credits: 4

A human-centric study of the principles used during the engineering of high-quality software systems. In addition to examining the human behaviors and social processes undergirding software development methodologies, students participate in teams tasked with designing, developing, and delivering a significant software application for a customer. During a weekly laboratory session, students use state-of-the-art software engineering, management, and communication tools to complete projects, reporting on their results through both written documents and oral presentations. Students are invited to use their own departmentally approved laptop in this course; a limited number of laptops are available for use during class and lab sessions. 

Prerequisite: CMPSC 101.

Distribution Requirements: SB, SP.

### Objectives

The process of developing software involves the application of a number of
interesting techniques and tools. During this class, we will explore the phases
of the software engineering lifecycle and examine the principles, challenges,
and open questions associated with each phase. Throughout the semester, we will
investigate the interplay between the theory and practice of software
engineering. Specifically, we will delve into the details of requirements
elicitation, design, implementation, testing, documentation, maintenance, and
deployment through a discussion of book chapters and articles from the software
engineering literature. 

Along with learning more about how to effectively work
in a team of diverse software developers, students will enhance their ability
to write and present ideas about software in a clear and compelling fashion.
Students will develop an understanding of the fascinating connections between
computer science and software engineering and other disciplines in the social
and natural sciences and the humanities. Students also will gain software
engineering experience when completing practical assignments and large-scale
projects.

### Outcomes

At the completion of this class, a student should be aware of the fundamental
challenges associated with software engineering. Furthermore, students should
be comfortable with a wide array of concepts, methodologies, techniques, and
tools that they apply to the problem of developing large software systems. A
successful student will emerge with more than an understanding of the tools
(e.g., text editors, compilers, linters, debuggers, automated testing
frameworks, integrated development environments, and version control systems)
that a software engineer uses. A student should also have an understanding of
the software engineering lifecycle and the activities that take place in each
of its phases. Finally, a student should have an understanding of some of the
current research and the open questions in the field of software engineering.
After completing this class, a student should be equipped for further graduate
study in the fields of computer science and software engineering. The student
should also be able to participate in real-world software development projects
by adeptly using cutting-edge software tools and working with a team of diverse
developers.

### Materials

The following textbooks are required for the course, they are all open-source and you do not need to purchase them. All reading material will be assigned weekly by the instructor and linked on the [course schedule](#Schedule).

#### Class activities

All students are required to actively participate during all of the class sessions. During nearly all class sessions, you will be required to complete and submit class activities (individually and in teams). You will receive a checkmark grade (1) if you complete more than 70% of the activity; otherwise you will receive a 0.

#### Reflection quizzes

At the beginning of nearly each class session (starting on week 2), students will be invited to take a short quiz reflecting on their understanding of the reading material.

#### Practical assignments

Graded on a credit/no-credit basis, these assignments allow students to enhance the technical skills that they learned in previous sessions. Practical submissions that do not receive a checkmark grade of 1 will be allowed to re-submit the assignment once. The submission for a re-grade should occur within two weeks of that practical grade being posted in GitHub.

#### Project assignments

Graded on a percentage and credit/no-credit basis, these team-based projects invite students to design, implement, test, document, deploy, and maintain a high-quality software system released under an open-source license through a publicly available GitHub repository. In addition to encouraging students to enhance their technical knowledge and skills, these projects will invite you to refine your ability to work effectively with a team.

#### Assignment submission

All assignments have a stated due date and are to be turned in electronically on that due date. By submitting each assignment a student pledges that they have complied with Allegheny Honor Code. You must follow assignments instructions for submitting your completed programs in order for them to be graded.  All of the late assignments must be submitted at the beginning of the session that is scheduled one week after the due date. Unless special arrangements are made with the course instructor, no assignments will be accepted after the late deadline.

#### Attendance

It is mandatory for all students to attend all of the class and laboratory sessions. There are two types of excused absences: 1) the one you notify the instructor about in advance (for example, if you have a job interview during the class/lab time or have a religious observance), 2) the one that occurs due to a documented emergency or illness. If you will not be able to attend a session, please let the instructor know at least one day in advance to describe your situation. In case you missed a class because of an emergency or an illness, please notify the instructor as soon as possible. In both cases the instructor will work with you to get you caught up. Students who miss more than five unexcused sessions will have their final grade in the course reduced by one letter grade. If you need to miss class due to a religious observance, please speak to me in advance to make appropriate arrangements.

#### Communication

Various digital channels are used in this course for communication, including email, Discord, and the GitHub issue tracker. Additionally, the course website is used to store the link to the course GitHub Organization, which will contain course syllabus, course schedule and the assignments. Students are responsible for regularly checking all platforms to ensure that the important messages are not being missed.

#### Allegheny College statement of community

Allegheny College also expects students and faculty to act according to its Statement of Community:

> Allegheny students and employees are committed to creating an inclusive, respectful and safe residential learning community that will actively confront and challenge racism, sexism, heterosexism, religious bigotry, and other forms of harassment and discrimination. We encourage individual growth by promoting a free exchange of ideas in a setting that values diversity, trust and equality. So that the right of all to participate in a shared learning experience is upheld, Allegheny affirms its commitment to the principles of freedom of speech and inquiry, while at the same time fostering responsibility and accountability in the exercise of these freedoms. This statement does not replace existing personnel policies and codes of conduct.

Keep both of these standards in mind as you exercise your academic inquiry in this course. These serve as our fundamental "first principles" in pursuit of our shared academic goals.

#### Honor code

All students and faculty at Allegheny College are bound by the Honor Code. Everyone expects that your behavior reflects this commitment. Given the eminently shareable and reproducible nature of code, the Department of Computer Science adds the following statement to the general college policy:

> It is recognized that an important part of the learning process in any course, and particularly in computer science, derives from thoughtful discussions with teachers, student assistants, and fellow students. Such dialogue is encouraged. However, it is necessary to distinguish carefully between the student who discusses the principles underlying a problem with others, and the student who produces assignments that are identical to, or merely variations on, someone else's work. It will therefore be understood that all assignments submitted to faculty of the Department of Computer Science are to be the original work of the student submitting the assignment, and should be signed in accordance with the provisions of the Honor Code. Appropriate action will be taken when assignments give evidence that they were derived from the work of others.

As the nature of "plagiarism" and constituents of "fair use" change often, the department encourages you to periodically review the specific tenets of the general college Honor Code provided in the latest course catalog and in the _Compass_.

The above statement, of course, also applies to online forums such as Stack Overflow, et al.

#### Classroom Ethics

The discipline of computer science, like many others, encourages its members to act according to discipline-specific ethics. I encourage you to take time to review the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) [Code of Ethics](https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/about/acm-code-of-ethics-booklet.pdf).

In addition, students in this class are required to act within the bounds established by the [Course Code of Conduct](https://github.com/CMPSC-203-Allegheny-College-Fall-2022/code_of_conduct.md). 

### Assistance

#### Assistance with course concepts

Students who struggle to understand knowledge and skills defined in this course are encouraged to seek assistance from the course instructor. Students who need the course instructor's assistance should schedule an appointment through her [Office Hour Calendar](https://janyljumadinova.com/schedule).

#### Academic Alerts

Allegheny College uses an Academic Alert system to send progress notices to the class deans in the Maytum Center for Student Success (MCSS). The progress notices are not punitive. They are an opportunity to connect you with your class dean who can offer additional support and suggest resources if you need assistance. These notices may encourage faculty advisors, coaches (for student-athletes), or other support staff to provide outreach to you as well.

#### Class Deans

The Office of Class Deans in Pelletier Library serves as a place for students to begin seeking assistance and answers to their questions related to college life. If you have a question and donâ€™t know who to ask â€“ ask a class dean. If you want advice â€“ talk to a class dean. Niki Fjeldal is the First Year Class Dean, Amy Stearns is the Second Year Class Dean / Director of Transfer Advising, and Jonathon May is the Third/Fourth Year Class Dean. Please contact them individually or through studentsuccess@allegheny.edu.

#### Mental Health and Wellness

As a college student, there may be times when personal stressors, struggles, and/or traumas interfere with your academic performance and/or negatively impact your daily life. Allegheny College recognizes that mental health is an important piece of the holistic human experience, and that this experience influences your academic success. We encourage students to prioritize their mental well-being by seeking services and support as needed.

Keep in mind, course deadlines, absences, and accommodations for mental health are subject to the course policies and expectations that are set within this syllabus. Students are encouraged to communicate with their professors as soon as possible regarding their needs and seek support if their mental health impacts their academic performance or daily life. When you find yourself struggling emotionally, remember that there are supports available, and you are not alone.

Students who are in need of mental health support can access free, confidential services and resources in the Counseling and Personal Development Center (CPDC). CPDC delivers holistic mental health services to the Allegheny College student campus community through brief individual and group counseling, crisis support, outreach programming, consultation, and coordination of care. Students may request services by submitting a form on CPDCâ€™s website (`sites.allegheny.edu/counseling`). Students may also connect with a mental health clinician at any time by calling Alleghenyâ€™s 24/7 line: 814-332-2105. 
If you or someone you know is experiencing a mental health emergency, please call the 24/7 line, Public Safety (814-332-3357), or 911. When in doubt, reach out.

#### Gator Success Grants

The Gator Success Grant program is designed to provide students with additional financial assistance to offset the total cost of college attendance and to encourage successful on-time degree completion. Currently enrolled students who have an unanticipated need are invited to apply. Grants are usually from a few hundred to a few thousand dollars, depending on the request and the studentâ€™s need. Please direct questions to `studentsuccess@allegheny.edu`.

#### Religious Observance 

If you need to miss class or reschedule a final examination due to a religious observance, please speak to the professor well in advance to make arrangements. Please see `https://sites.allegheny.edu/religiouslife/religious-holy-days/` for more details.

#### Educational Accommodations

Students with disabilities who believe they may need accommodations in this class are encouraged to contact Student Accessibility and Support Services (SASS) at (814) 332-2898.  Student Accessibility and Support Services is located in Pelletier Library.  Please do this as soon as possible to ensure that such accommodations are implemented in a timely fashion.
